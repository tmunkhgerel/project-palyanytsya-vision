## Technical Overview

This project represents the integration of **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)** to support territorial recovery and defensive operations. By converting raw UAV data into actionable intelligence, I enhance situational awareness and strategic decision-making.

### Defensive Excellence & Analytics
* **AI-Driven ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance):** Developed autonomous identification models for the detection and analysis of armored assets (T-series units) within the Kharkiv region.
* **Geospatial Intelligence:** Engineered data-driven mapping solutions to track territorial recovery, supporting both logistical movements and humanitarian efforts.
* **Operational Impact:** Streamlined real-time data processing pipelines to provide frontline units with high-fidelity results, enhancing tactical precision and personnel safety.

## Tech Stack & Methodology

* **Artificial Intelligence:** Object detection and classification for hardware identification.
* **Geospatial Tools:** Mapping and analysis of recovered territories using satellite and UAV telemetry.
* **Edge Computing:** Real-time data processing for immediate field results.

## Ethical Commitment
The development of these tools is strictly governed by the principles of **sovereignty, international law, and the restoration of peace.** My goal is to use technology as a shield for freedom and a catalyst for global stability.
